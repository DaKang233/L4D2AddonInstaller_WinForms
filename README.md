# L4D2AddonInstaller_WinForms
A tool software that helps users to install Left 4 Dead 2 Add-Ons simply and solves the problem that the author has had to teach every new member joining in the gaming party to install addons, which has led to time waste.

This tool was built in Windows Forms. Currently it is available for formal usage, but the author is coding for new functions.
